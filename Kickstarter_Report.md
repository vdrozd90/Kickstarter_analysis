## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise by completing an analysis on several crowdfunding projects. In a short amount of time, Louiseâ€™s play Fever almost achieved its fundraising goal. Through the analysis, we will help Louise to understand how different campaigns performed in relation to her launch dates and funding goals.
